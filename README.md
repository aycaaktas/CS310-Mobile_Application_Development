# CS310-Mobile_Application_Development
Two projects I developed through CS310 Mobile Application course in Sabancı University to improve myself on Mobile Application development on Android.

# About the WEB API Project
I created a Web API that manages money transactions between accounts for a bank. Accounts can be created and transactions can be made from one account to the other. All communications are through HTTP protocol, and data must be exchanged in JSON format. I used Spring Framework and Java programming language to create the API. To manage the database I used MongoDB.

# About the NEWS APPLICATION Project

I created an Android Application that uses News API. When starts, display tabs for each news category.  When the user selects a category using tabs, displays the list of news accordingly (image, title, and text of news). When a news item is selected the app displays the details of the news. When the “View Comments” button is clicked from News Detail the comments for that news are shown. Appbar contains a "pen" button to navigate to the Post Comment page. I used Android Studio and Java programming language to create the App.
