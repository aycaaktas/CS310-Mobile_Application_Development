I created an Android Application that uses News API. When starts, display tabs for each news category. 
When the user selects a category using tabs, display the list of news accordingly (image, title, and text of news).
When a news item is selected from the app displays the details of the news. 
When the “View Comments” button is clicked from News Detail the comments for that news are shown. 
Appbar contains a "pen" button to navigate to the Post Comment page. I used Android Studio and Java programming language to create the App.
